###Work in Progess

Linux-based standin for Lambda based on Python Flask and the dockerised release of DynamoDB.

The purpose of this is to allow faster editing of python lambda functions while still in heavy development.

More documentation to come but basically it could be used as a temporary replacement for Lambda in API Gateway (by using the HTTP option and pointing it a server running this stack)

To start, download this repo install docker and docker-compose and run the docker-compose.yml file.
